# The Best Words: A Comparative Textual Analysis of Trump Inaugural Addresses

## Introduction

Donald J. Trump, the 45th and again incumbent US president, is one of only two presidents to serve two non-consecutive terms. Trump's first term from 2017 to 2020 was characterised by tougher immigration controls, increased political polarisation, and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the months preceding and directly after the 2020 election, there was a marked widening of the partisan gap between those in favour of the populist ideals of Trump and those favouring the purported establishment which Trump had poised himself to counter. This among many factors culminated in the January 6 Capitol Riot, in which a radical fraction of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn his recent defeat in the 2020 elections. These circumstances were partially driven by claims of election-rigging by Trump which became a prevailing part of his anti-establishment rhetoric.

However, in 2024 Trump won the US election, this time by popular vote, beating out former Vice President Kamala Harris, and reassuming his role as President in an unprecedented political comeback. Political theorists hypothesise on how this second term may differ from the first, in light of dramatic social and political changes that have developed globally since 2020 in addition to the aftermath of the two attempted assassinations on Trump.

This analysis includes a visualisations of a comparative textual analysis of both the 2017 and 2025 Trump Inaugural Addresses in order to assess general textual features in addition to sentiment and how this may reflect a development in the rhetoric of Trump.
