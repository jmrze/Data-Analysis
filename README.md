# Data-Analysis
Welcome to my portfolio. I am James, I hold an MSci in Genetics with Data Science from the University of Glasgow and this portfolio is a showcase of example data analysis and visualisations that I have conducted. 

I have particularly focused on work conducted in R, which formed a significant part of my Honours year modules.

Thank you
James
